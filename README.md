# HackerNews Deck
HackerNews Deck is an app to browse HackerNews in TweetDeck style with columns.

I built this as a way to learn and play with NextJS.

It is hosted on Netlify.

## Resources it uses:
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
[Bulma (CSS)](https://bulma.io/)
[FontAwesome (icons)](https://fontawesome.com/)
[HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
[Netlify (host)](https://www.netlify.com/)
